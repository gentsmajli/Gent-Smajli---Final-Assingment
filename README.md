# Gent-Smajli---Final-Assingment
After downloading all the files, the project can be run on any computer without changing any file paths. Each Stata script automatically detects the folder it’s located in and uses that as the working directory, so all files (data, code, and graphs) are linked through relative paths. To reproduce the analysis, simply open Stata, set the working directory to the project folder, and run do master.do. The master script will sequentially execute all steps — loading the dataset, cleaning and transforming it, generating summary statistics, and exporting the graphs — without requiring any manual path adjustments.
